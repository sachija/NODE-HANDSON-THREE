what is middleware?
The middleware in node.js is a function that will have all the access for requesting an object, responding to an object, and moving to the next middleware function in the application request-response cycle. This function can be used for modifying the req and res objects for tasks like adding response headers, parsing requesting bodies, and so on.
With Node.js middleware, you can run any code and modify the request and response objects. You can also call for the next middleware in the stack when the current one is completed
